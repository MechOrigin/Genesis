Most_relevant_data: Early varieties were described in a 1904 nurseryman's catalogue as having "...edible fruits the size of walnuts, and the flavor of ripe gooseberries",[5] and Europeans called it Chinese gooseberry.In 1959 it was exported under the name "melonette".[6] In 1962, New Zealand growers began calling it "kiwifruit" for export marketing, a name becoming commercially adopted in 1974. A California-based importer named Frieda Caplan subsequently used that name when introducing the fruit to the American market.[7] The word kiwifruit and the shortened kiwi, have been used since around 1966, when the fruit was first exported from New Zealand to the United States.[6][8] Kiwifruit has since become a common name for all commercially grown fruit from the genus Actinidia.[9] In New Zealand, the shortened word, "kiwi", is seldom used to refer to the fruit, as it usually refers to the kiwi bird or the Kiwi people.[6][8]
